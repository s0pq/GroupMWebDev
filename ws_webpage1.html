		<p class="greenBlock"> Green tracks are a part of sustainable cities by bringing more plant life to areas otherwise devoid of it. Not a lot of train stations have a large amount of greenary, and if they do, then I must be blind because I haven't seen a green track. Not from Portlaoise to Dublin Heuston, anyway. Dublin Heuston is literally the least green place. It's concrete and pebbles. And a lot of pigeons. Almost too many pigeons. Portlaoise station isn't better, if you were wondering. It's miserable. Yes, there's trees along the tracks, but that doesn't make it a "green track". A green track, as defined by Western Sydney University, is "Green track is a vegetative layer composed of turf, grasses or groundcovers, planted into light rail track beds". The most Portlaoise has is moss. Does moss count? Not really, moss will grow anywhere. And someone needs to tell whoever handles Portlaoise station that the weeds growing on the wall of the station doesn't really fall into the category of greenary.</p>

		<p class="greenBlock">Now that I've finished complaining, let's look at the benefits. What exactly is the point of a green track? Why should we bother? Well let me start off by saying this: They lower the noise level. How many times have you been more than 500 metres away from the train station and heard the clattering of the train's wheels? It's honestly scary when you don't expect it. And when you live right next to a train track or a track station, you're surronded by noise. You get sick of it. "Just move out!" I hear you say. Move house??? In THIS economy?? Noise reduction is one of the best benefits of a green track, in my opinion. In addition to reducing noise, the vegetation present in green tracks absorbs storm water, which reduces pressure on sewage systems. Beautification can be seen as another benefit. The colour green is said to have a calming effect on people, and I know for sure if you commute you need to be calm, being surronded by loud noises and bright lights. Seriously Irish Rail, you don't need to shine down the brightest white light in my face at 6 in the morning. I believe that if we had more vegetation on our rails, we could make travelling by train a more pleasant experience. Of course, some rail services would be more difficult to implement this in. For example, the LUAS. It runs through the city, so you can't have a green track there. As unfortunate as it is.</p>
